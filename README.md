# Star Wars RPG
Interactive game using jQuery to dynamically update HTML pages - Star Wars theme

## Objective
Select a player from the listed characters as Player 1. The remaining characters will move to the "Enemies Available to Attack" section, from where a Player 2 will be chosen. The game is over when Player 1 has defeated all of the enemies from the game.

### How It Works
The user selects a character as their player (Player 1), then selects a different character as their enemy (Player 2). Whenever the attack button is clicked, each user will have their health points reduced by the amount of attack power(Player 1)/counter attack power (Player 2) which is  randomly generated when the page loads. If the user wins, they will have to choose another opponent to face. The user wins the game when all opponents have been defeated. If the user loses, the game is over and the user will have to restart the game to try their luck again.
